# Data Repository for Manuscript: &ldquo;Interfacial Strain Effects on Lithium Diffusion Pathways in the Spinel Solid Electrolyte Li-Doped MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&rdquo;

## Summary

This repository contains the key raw data discussed in the manuscript:

C. Oâ€™Rourke and B. J. Morgan, &ldquo;Interfacial Strain Effects on Lithium Diffusion Pathways in the Spinel Solid Electrolyte Li-Doped MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&rdquo;, T.B.D.

Along with the data is a selection of scripts which when run strip the relevant quantities out of the raw data files and perfrom the analysis to produce the figures in the manuscript.

## Overview

In this directory there are two main files and a folder `images` that contains additional figures.
* `spinel_paper_generating_figures.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the main analysis. When run this will output the figure images presented in the main manuscript to the `../figures/` directory.
* `figure_formatting.py`: Formatting options and routines used by the main Jupyter notebook.
* `images`: Folder containing images illustrating pathways, required by the main Jupyter notebook.
